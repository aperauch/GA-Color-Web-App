Genetic Algorithms with Colors

This is the code I use for a Google App Engine web application. The purpose of the app is the combine biology concepts of fitness, crossover, recombination, and mutation to programming. This app lets you pick a color and then tries (poorly) to create a population of colors that are the "fittest" from an evoluation of colors. A simple Hamming code is used to test fitness or binary distance from the selected color.
